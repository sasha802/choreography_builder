                <h3>Why Ballroom Dance is fun.</h3>
                <p>
                    Ballroom and Latin dance music is quite simply fabulous and it makes you want to dance.
                    I defy anyone to listen to 'Shout It Feel It' by the Count Basie Orchestra and not want to at
                    least tap their feet! Dancing aside there has been a resurgence in interest in jazz and swing music,
                    Michael Buble and Jamie Cullum being two modern exponents of the genre, and this has only helped
                    dance to once again capture the public imagination.

                <h3>About My First Dance</h3>
                <p>
                    The "first dance" of a married couple is a popular element at modern European and American wedding
                    receptions or post-wedding celebrations. The newly married couple, as the guests of honor at a dance,
                    open the dancing.The style of dance is a personal choice. Some couples opt for a rehearsed,
                    choreographed dance, whereas sources like etiquette columnist Judith Martin feel that performing
                    a choreographed duet for spectators is inappropriate. In the past, the couple did not dance the first
                    dance alone. In her 1922 guide, Ettiquette, Emily Post recommended that newlyweds not join the
                    dancing until after their guests had begun, and simply dance with one another first before moving
                    on to other partners. This occurred while other guests continued dancing, and was not given particular
                    attention or treated as a performance. In the current times, ballroom dance is not a skill that is
                    common within society. Therefore, some modern couples either slow dance or learn a dance, whether
                    it be a ballroom dance style or a choreographed dance routine. The music to which they dance is also
                    highly varied, with modern chart hits often being selected. Teaching and rehearsing the "first dance"
                    is now a service offered by dance studios, independent dance instructors and specialist wedding dance
                    tuition companies
